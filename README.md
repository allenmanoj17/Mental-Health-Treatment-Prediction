# Detection, Prediction and Analysis of Mental Well-Being

### Problem Statement
Mental health issues in people have shown drastic increases affecting almost all age groups. Most of these issues remain uncured and neglected due to lack of awareness and being considered a taboo concept in our society. To be aware of susceptibilities towards mental health, early detection is an essential procedure.
